## **Project Concept**

A fully onchain virtual pet game that brings the nostalgic 90s Tamagotchi experience to Web3, where each pet is a unique digital entity living entirely on the blockchain.

## **Core Features**

- Pets exist as autonomous agents using World Engine's entity component system
- Pet states and actions are fully verifiable onchain
- Each pet has unique DNA/traits that influence behavior
- Pets require care (feeding, playing, cleaning) to stay healthy
- Real-time aging and evolution system

## **Business Model**

**Egg Gacha**

- Users pay to obtain an egg that will hatch into their virtual pet with a gacha-like system

**Virtual Items**

- Food tokens
- Toys and accessories
- Medicine and care items
- Premium environments/habitats

**Breeding System**

- Fee for breeding two pets
- Marketplace royalties from pet trading
